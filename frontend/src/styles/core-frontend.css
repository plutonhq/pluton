/*
 * Placeholder file for development mode.
 * In dev mode, Vite processes SCSS files on-the-fly, so CSS module styles are generated automatically.
 * In production builds (npm package), this file is replaced with the pre-compiled CSS bundle
 * containing all CSS module styles with consistent hashes.
 * 
 * DO NOT add styles here - they will be overwritten in production.
